# QR Code Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV
This repository provides a simple implementation for detecting QR codes using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) and OpenCV. YOLOv8 is a real-time object detection algorithm, and with the integration of OpenCV, we can extend its capabilities to recognize QR codes.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* PyTorch (install according to your CUDA version if you have a GPU)
* OpenCV
* YOLOv8
* Google Colab
